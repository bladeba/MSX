For IPS Patch use this original ROM: 

**SHA-1**
4d51d3c5036311392b173a576bc7d91dc9fed6cb	


Finally you will obtain a ROM with a size of 512 Kbytes and **KONAMI SCC Mapper**


* If you want to play it in [webMSX](http://webmsx.org/) put in the name of the ROM [KonamiSCC]

example:Galious[KonamiSCC].ROM

Issues: Not compatible with Game Master

##
Notes:
  - For emulation, use [openMSX](https://openmsx.org/) or [webMSX](http://webmsx.org/)... or some effects wonÂ´t work correctly.
  - The gameplay is exactly the same as the original game (but smoother...)
  - Now the game is in screen 5 mode. All graphics were remade.
  - Hold **TAB** to throttle the game speed (by FRS)
  - In **Item Menu** press CTRL to toggle descriptions (weapons or items)
  - There is a special way to listen all the musics... I hope you can find it.... ;-)
