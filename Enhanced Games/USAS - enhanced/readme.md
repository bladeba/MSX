**USAS(RC-753) enhanced Version 1.03**
by Victor Martinez
##

This patch implements:

  - SCC Music Arrangement by [Koichiro](http://xirco.mods.jp/index.html)
  - Enables the TURBOCPU in PANASONIC TR & 2+ and ExpertTurbo
  - TurboFIX routine (original routine by FRS)
  - [Joymega](http://frs.badcoffee.info/hardware/joymega-en.html) support: START = pause (thanks to FX)
  - Selectable at boot: Language, sound, VDP freq., cheats...
  - Enhanced sprite routines: faster, and double buffer
  - Double PSG if a [MegaflashROM SD](https://www.msxcartridgeshop.com/) is found (only with SCC music)
       MegaflashROM SD PSG->Music,  Internal PSG->Sound Effects
       It must be in "slot expander" mode

**Attention**!!: You will obtain a 2Mbit ROM with KONAMI-SCC mapper type.

This version should work correctly in any MSX2 or higher.

It's compatible with the BiFi's "Emoticons patch"

Issues: not full compatible with Game Master 2.



Thanks to: Koichiro, FRS, David Madurga,FX and Manuel Pazos.
