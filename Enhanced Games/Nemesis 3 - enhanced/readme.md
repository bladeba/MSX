**Nemesis 3 (RC-764) enhanced Version 1.03**


for MSX2 or higher (recommended TurboCPU)
by Victor Martinez
##

Apply the IPS patch in Nemesis 3 original ROM file. You will obtain a 3Mbit ROM.

This version should work correctly in any MSX2 or higher. For emulation, use [openMSX](https://openmsx.org/) for the best experience.

For [webMSX](http://webmsx.org/), apply the webMSX IPS patch(not the other): correct line interrupt and joymega support disabled.

This patch implements:
  
  - TurboFIX routine (original routine by [FRS](http://frs.badcoffee.info/))

  - Voice Set (SCC in other slot/subslot) by **WYZ**/**ARTRAG**.
      - New Voicet SET with better sound quality and a lot of new voices.
      - You can have the ROM of the game and the other SCC for Voice SET in the same slot expander.

- Change log:
  
    V1.03:<br> 
        - New **David Burton** image created by **FRS**<br>
        - MSX1 Message Only for MSX2 or higher<br>
        - Fixed Joymega routine completely<br>
            
                
    V1.02: Fixed some issues with Joymega buttons A & START
   
    V1.01: Included in INI screen option to enable Joymega adapter. With a normal joypad could be some issues... Thanks to Raul.

Issues: **NOT** compatible with [Game Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Game_Master). Now the game works in IM2 mode...

Note: I'ld like to include a retranslation created by "*232 translations*"... but, in this game, all the texts are stored as
compresed graphics... so... it'd be really difficult to be implemented... Sorry... 



Thanks to: David Madurga,Toni Galvez, WYZ, FRS, FX and Vampier... and more and more people...
